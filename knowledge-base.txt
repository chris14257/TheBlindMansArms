# The Blind Man's Arms - Knowledge Base

## About The Pub

The Blind Man's Arms is a community gastro pub in the heart of Wiltshire. We believe a village pub should taste like its surroundings: ingredients grown, reared and crafted within sight of our doorstep; beers and spirits brewed just down the lane; and menus that follow the seasons rather than the latest fad.

Everything we do is rooted in three ideas:
- Creativity in the kitchen and behind the bar
- Craft in the way we cook, pour and host
- Community in the way we share our space with local makers, growers and neighbours year-round

## The Team

The Blind Man's Arms is steered by a small but fiercely imaginative crew:

### Christopher The Blind - Head Chef
Christopher proves daily that you don't need eyes to have exceptional vision in the kitchen. He is the person to speak to about special opening requests and bookings.

### Sherpa Shirl - Creative Director
Sherpa Shirl guides guests through seasonal events, decor and community projects with the calm focus of someone who's led more than a few expeditions.

### Simon Nutkin - Chief Mixology Officer
Simon's cocktail creations are part science experiment, part theatre and entirely drinkable.

Together they keep one eye on local suppliers, one on warm hospitality, and at least one firmly on making sure nobody's glass or plate stays empty for long.

## The Blind Man's Arms Name

The name "The Blind Man's Arms" is a playful reference to the nursery rhyme "Three Blind Mice" - where the farmer's wife cuts off the mice's tails with a carving knife. In our version, she's caught up with the blind men instead. It's dark British humour at its finest, perfectly suited to a traditional English pub.

Our head chef Christopher is blind, which adds another layer to the name - he proves daily that you don't need eyes to have exceptional vision in the kitchen.

The pub is part of The Open Eyed Man hospitality group - award winning English hospitality.
